		module Body
			# A body that invokes a block that can read and write to a stream.
			#
			# In some cases, it's advantageous to directly read and write to the underlying stream if possible. For example, HTTP/1 upgrade requests, WebSockets, and similar. To handle that case, response bodies can implement `stream?` and return `true`. When `stream?` returns true, the body **should** be consumed by calling `call(stream)`. Server implementations may choose to always invoke `call(stream)` if it's efficient to do so. Bodies that don't support it will fall back to using `#each`.
			#
			# When invoking `call(stream)`, the stream can be read from and written to, and closed. However, the stream is only guaranteed to be open for the duration of the `call(stream)` call. Once the method returns, the stream **should** be closed by the server.
